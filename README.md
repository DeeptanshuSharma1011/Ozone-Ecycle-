# Ozone-Ecycle-
Ozone is an innovation-driven project that transforms a manual bicycle into a fully functional electric cycle by integrating components like a battery pack, electric gear kit, throttle, and a stand-down ignition lock.

A mobile app prototype complements the hardware by providing smart features such as:

Real-time battery percentage

GPS tracking & cycle location

Distance covered & performance stats

Overview of cycle features and diagnostics

This project combines sustainable transport engineering with smart IoT-based monitoring, offering a clean and connected cycling experience.
